# CS415-Projects
This is repository for CS415 Projects. 

## -> 1
This is the 1st MP for the class that was tutorial, adding some elements and a creative portion.
The creative element that I added was sound that I created using Garageband. 

## -> 2
This is the 2nd (last individual) MP for the class. The MP was divided into 2 parts. This repo is updated to the final submission
which means that it has both parts completed. The submission also involved a [Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ir592f0VpeDa2yRaFb4X9zX0pj--5_vByw8mlvLlPfI/edit) which is linked.
